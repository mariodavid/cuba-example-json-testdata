# cuba-example-json-testdata
This example shows how to load test data at application startup time in your CUBA application.

The JSON test data can be exported through the entity inspector or the concrete screens (like security groups browse).

These files have to be put in the [data](https://github.com/mariodavid/cuba-example-json-testdata/tree/master/modules/core/src/data) directory.

Then they will be picked up and imported into the system in a DBMS independent way.
